## Goal

Introduce the audience to Dat and its core modules. Learn about P2P architectures and it's differences with the common client/server scenario of regular web apps. Also learn how to combine Dat and web app business logic creating this way, P2P web apps.

## About the app
We will be working on a P2P/WebRTC chat app, the final result looks like: [Olaf](https://olafchat.netlify.com/) and it works like a P2P PWA, one user create a room then shares it (dat link) with the rest and that's it! :cat2:
